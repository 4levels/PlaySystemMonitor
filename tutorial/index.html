            <h2>Play System Monitor</h2>
            <p>
               This Application demonstrates the importance of Event streams.
                Taking data from the server located at data center to the Network monitoring center
                is defacto now a days. Data analytics plays a crucial role in businesses.
                A stitch in time saves nine applies here.So, Taking the data from the server to web browser 
                and showing data in terms of Charts is very important for easy comprehension.

                    <p>
                        Play system monitor uses <code>top</code> command line utility of linux/unix to
                        send the system memory and CPU usage statistics to the web UI using event source.
                        <code>top -b</code> produces system memory, cpu usage data continuosly. <code>top -b</code> -b means top runs in batch mode and sends the data that can be captured and used by other programs.

                    <h2>Top Linux Utility</h2>
                    <p>
                        Please check top command to know more about it or do <code>man top</code> to read the man page of the top command.
                        Now process API of scala helps to execute the system commands from the Scala code and the output stream of the data produces by the system command can be captured.
                        Here is the code snippet which helps us to understand executing system command from scala
                        <code>
                            import sys.process._
                            "cat somefile.txt".!!
                        </code>
                        The above code executes the cat command and prints the output to the scala console
                        Note that the <code>top -b</code> continuously produces the data so we capture that stream of data in the iterator rather than consuming it at once. So, we request the iterator while executing the linux command.
                        <code>
                            import sys.process._
                            "top -b".lines_!.iterator
                        </code>
